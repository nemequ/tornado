Date        Version  New features compared to previous version

2007-04-16  0.1      Bytecoder, bitcoder and 2^n semi-dynamic RangeCoder
                     Greedy parsing
                     Only 4+ byte matches
                     Hashtable matchfinders: simple and caching
                     Blockwise compression

2007-05-11  0.2      Huffman coder
                     Lazy parsing
                     3-byte matches
                     Dropping too far matches
                     Sliding window
                     Gzip-like cmdline interface

2007-07-25  0.25     Repdist, repboth and repchar codes
                     2-byte matches
                     Improved lz parsing
                     Delta filter

2008-03-13  0.3      Huffman decoder with variable block size
                     Tested on 100 gb of data and fixed all bugs found

2008-04-08  0.4      Cycling matchfinder
                     Large, updated at each step hashes for 2/3-byte strings
                     More interactive user interface

2008-06-02  0.4a     Fixed bug in Huffman coder: unstable sorting
                     Win32 & Linux versions

2008-10-28  0.4b     Added -11:c1 .. -11:c3 modes

2014-01-15  0.5      Removed modes -6 -8 -10 -12, renumerated -7/9/11 to -6/7/8
                     -7/-8: 1% better compression and 5-20% better speed due to use of ht5
                     New -9..-11 modes: 2gb hash and ht5..ht7 match finders
                     In small tornado.exe -c1..-c3 available for -7..-11 modes
                     Support for -l not power of 2   (in all matchfinders?)
                     Options -ah, -al, -t#, -cpu, -q, -delete, stats->stderr
                     Checks at decoding in order to prevent segfaults
                     MSVC/ICL compatibility, use of wall-clock times
                     Linux: 64-bit file offsets!
                     PowerPC (big-endian cpus) compatibility, thanks to Joachim Henke
                     64-bit compilers support!
                     -3 mode compression improved by 2-3%
                     2mb hash in -4/-5 modes improved speed by 20-30%
                     Fixed long-standing decompression bug (table split across 2 write chunks)
                     Removed CHECK_FOR_DATA_TABLE(2) in -3/-4 modes
